# Quantum-Computing
Instead of making a new repository for each quantum computing framework I use, each will have a folder here.

Current Frameworks in this Repository:

- Qiskit (IBM Framework for Gate-Based Quantum Computing)
- Ocean (D-Wave Framework for Quantum Annealing)
- Xanadu StrawberryFields (Photonic Quantum Computing)
- Cirq (Google)
